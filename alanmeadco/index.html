    <h1>Hi! I’m Alan – a qualified Coach and a proven Learning & Development professional with over 30 years’ experience in Advertising, Production and L&D.</h1>

    <p>I believe we are all capable of so much more. Wherever we want to thrive and really achieve our dreams and ambitions. At work and at home.</p>

    <p>But it’s easy to get blocked and lose our way then spend too much time looking elsewhere for the answers that are actually within us already.</p>

    <p><a href="#coaching" class="smooth-scroll">Coaching</a> helps you to get closer to those answers and achieve things you might previously have not thought possible. It helps you to unlock your potential.</p>

    <p>And with the appropriate <a href="#training" class="smooth-scroll">Training</a>, you or your teams can plug essential knowledge and skills gaps, especially in the workplace, that will help you to grow and progress.</p>

    <p><strong>That’s why I’m a Coach and a Trainer.</strong></p>

    <p>The Coaching could be focused on issues and challenges in your personal life.</p>

    <p>Or it could be about a work issue affecting you or one of your colleagues. In a work context, I’m experienced working at all levels, from new starters through to Executive Coaching at Board level.<p>

    <p>Either way, it’s made up of a series of one to one sessions, ideally face to face and typically around 90 minutes long. Usually, we would agree the specific topic you want to discuss in these sessions in advance and we would always have an initial chat first before you commit to any formal arrangements, just to see how we get on!</p>

          Helen was going through a challenging period at work. Alan’s easy-going manner allowed her to open up without any barriers - she has come out of the sessions with a clear sense of purpose and a renewed confidence and energy.

          Alan's training has quote about not being told what to do and automatically resisting it, but owning the solution and wanting to make it happen. Would recommend to a friend.
