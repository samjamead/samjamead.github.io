#### Good freelancers have their portfolio on hand at all times; whether they’re in the office, on a train, or up a mountain. Here’s mine.

I'm a web developer working with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. My speciality is creating static websites using Jekyll, which can be hosted for free on GitHub pages. Recently I've been working more and more with Google's Firebase, which is a powerful yet simple realtime database. It's perfect for building quick and beautiful MVPs.

In reverse chronolgical order, projects I've worked on:

### [Yabble](https://www.yabble.com.au) <br />
Yabble is built using the Aurelia frontend framework which has been fun to work with. I implemented a fresh redesign for Yabble, with the help of Yabble CTO Dan Pickering, who previously headed up dev teams for TradeMe in New Zealand, and desgined brilliant designer called Leo Walton.

### [The Anengu Coffee Project](http://anengucoffeeproject.org) <br />
Built on a flight from Sydney to Perth and launched from Perth Arrivals. Simple one page website, pre loaded with Jekyll for ease of expansion if needed in the future.

<br />

### [Uproute](http://uproute.co) <br />
My baby! I designed Uproute and built it with a combination of Jekyll and a JavaScript app using jQuery and Firebase to handle our users. Hosted on Github Pages. I think I am pushing the boundaries of how one can use Jekyll, but so far so good, and it's showing no signs of slowing down yet! Shoutout to Nik Brbora built some extremely handy scripts to regenerate our Jekyll website based on a database. Thanks Nik :)

### [Arpadio](https://arpadio.github.io/eloRatingApp/) <br />
A frameworkless JavaScript single page app: a little project to implement the Elo Rating System as a web app. Watch this space for bigger things, including but not limited to Chess Ratings As A Service (CRAAS)...

### [Bootstrapped Jekyll](http://mead.fm/bootstrappedJekyll) <br />
A quick starter kit and pseudo-tutorial for anyone wanting to strip Jekyll of its default style and use Bootstrap instead.

<br />

### [Mead.fm](http://mead.fm) <br />
Of course, I built my own blog! Months of tinkering, the design changes every 10 minutes.
