Good freelancers have their portfolio on hand at all times; whether they’re in the office, on a train, or up a mountain. Here’s mine.

I'm a web developer working with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. My speciality is creating static websites using Jekyll, which can be hosted for free on GitHub pages.


[Uproute](http://uproute.co) <br />
My baby! Designed and built with Jekyll, hosted with Github Pages. We also use a small React app to handle our users. Shoutout to Nik Brbora who build the React app, plus some scripts to regenerate our Jekyll website based on a database. Thanks Nik :)

[Arpadio](https://arpadio.github.io/eloRatingApp/) <br />
A frameworkless JavaScript single page app: a little project to implement the Elo Rating System as a web app. Watch this space for bigger things, including but not limited to Chess Ratings As A Service (CRAAS)...

[Bootstrapped Jekyll](http://mead.fm/bootstrappedJekyll) <br />
A quick starter kit and pseudo-tutorial for anyone wanting to strip Jekyll of its default style and use Bootstrap instead.
