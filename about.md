<hr />

In 2011 I cofounded my first company with some friends from university. It didn't go very well, but my [second](http://saberr.com) attempt has done much better.

I moved to WA as a love tourist in February 2014. Since then I've been helping other startups, entrepreneurs and small businesses avoid some of the mistakes that Iâ€™ve made along the way. Call it mentorship, advice, coaching, or whatever - I love collaborating with everyone here in the Perth startup scene.

My most recent company, [Codename Canary](http://codenamecanary.org/), is a continuation of a project that came second at the seventh Startup Weekend Perth. We're cleaning up the world's coastlines, oceans, and landscapes one Instagram hashtag at a time.

If you're interested in having a chat, I'd love to hear from you, so drop me a [tweet](https://twitter.com/samjamead) and let's start the conversation!

Outside of tech startups, I'm passionate about making the world a little bit more environmentally conscious, as well as surfing, skiing, and camping. And golf. And woodwork. And languages. I have too many hobbies.
