Hey! If we haven't met before, I'm Sam, a front end web developer and all-round startup guy in Perth, WA.

In my last year of university I cofounded a company with some friends. It didn't go very well, we learnt a lot, and my [second attempt](http://saberr.com) has done much better.

I came to WA as a love tourist in March 2013, and for the first year or so I flew back and forth to London to keep building Saberr. Since February 2014 I've been helping other startups, entrepreneurs and small businesses avoid some of the mistakes that Iâ€™ve made along the way. Call it freelancing, mentorship, advice, coaching, or whatever &mdash; I love collaborating with everyone here in the Perth startup scene.

Recently I've been part of a few really exciting projects &mdash; [Uproute](http://uproute.co), a company helping travellers plan perfect itineraries; [Snaptrash](http://snaptrash.org), the continuation of an environmental project that came second at the seventh Startup Weekend Perth; and as a mentor for [Vocus Upstart](http://www.vocusupstart.com.au), a tech accelerator here in the city.

If you're interested in having a chat, I'd love to hear from you, so come along to [Morning Startup](http://www.meetup.com/Morning-Startup-Perth/) or shoot me a [Tweet](https://twitter.com/samjamead) and let's start the conversation!

Outside of tech startups, I'm passionate about making the world a little bit more environmentally conscious, as well as surfing, skiing, and camping. And Oxford commas, golf, and woodwork. And volunteering for St John Ambulance. And languages. I have too many hobbies.
