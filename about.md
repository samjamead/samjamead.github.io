In 2011 I cofounded my first company with some friends from university. It didn't go very well, but my [second](http://saberr.com) attempt has done much better.

Since moving to WA in February 2014 I've been helping other startups, entrepreneurs and small businesses avoid some of the mistakes that Iâ€™ve made along the way. Call it mentorship, advice, coaching, or whatever - I love helping others in the startup world.

If you're interested in having a chat, I'd love to hear from you, so drop me an [email](mailto:samjamead@gmail.com) and let's start the conversation.

Outside of tech startups, I'm passionate about making the world a little bit more environmentally conscious, as well as surfing, skiing, and camping.
