Sunk within a minute of impact, a day out of the Galapagos. Taken aboard 38 days later.

> We trimmed the dingy so that the bow would ride a little higher and shook out the reef again so that we could steer Ednamair with the sail and keep her bow pointing into any of the more dangerous waves, for some of them were running accross the wind in a most confused fashion, catching us broadside on.

Reflecting on the experience:

> Things like putting three days' food and water in the stores, and then telling the castaway to be careful with it for he might be on the raft for twenty-one days. Or packing eighteen pints of water, supplies for ten persons for three days at two pints a day each. This exercises the castaway's mind especially if he doesn't have his personal statistician along to reassured him that he isn't barmy. There are so many ludicrous statements made in these books that one is tempted to look askance at the useful information that they contain, on princicple.

I'd be interested to hear from Robin...
