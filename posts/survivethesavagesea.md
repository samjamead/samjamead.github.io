As I was leaving Leo's house I overheard him try to lend a book to Pin. Her polite declining of his offer led the book to be redirected to me. It's important to stress that he didn't offer a single word of recommendation; he just asked if I wanted to borrow it. From the title I thought it was likely to be a textbook of sorts about sailing in rough weather, so I thought I'd take it, skim through it, and then at some point in the future randomly remember some facts about putting in 4th reefs an hour after it would have been useful. Ha!

In fact the book is the autobiographical account of the Robertson family, whose yacht sinks within a minute of impacted by three killer whales. They're a day out of the Galapagos at the time, it's sometime in the 1970s, and for the next 38 (yes, _thirty eight_) days they survive on experience alone.

> We trimmed the dingy so that the bow would ride a little higher and shook out the reef again so that we could steer Ednamair with the sail and keep her bow pointing into any of the more dangerous waves, for some of them were running across the wind in a most confused fashion, catching us broadside on.

At the end of the book, Dougal reflects on how unnecessarily precarious and uncomfortable the experience had been, chastising the seaworthiness of their so called 'survival' equipment and rations:

> Things like putting three days' food and water in the stores, and then telling the castaway to be careful with it for he might be on the raft for twenty-one days. Or packing eighteen pints of water, supplies for ten persons for three days at two pints a day each. This exercises the castaway's mind especially if he doesn't have his personal statistician along to reassure him that he isn't barmy. There are so many ludicrous statements made in these books that one is tempted to look askance at the useful information that they contain, on principle.

It all seems like worthwhile criticism, but it's also important to remember that the raft and provisions they _did_ have with them were almost an afterthought.

The book is extraordinary and mad, and while Dougal is forthcoming with some self-critique, it makes you imagine that there's much left out of the book.
