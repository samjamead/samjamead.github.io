A brief timeline of following England Cricket

- I love it! Agreed, I would much rather lose a thriller than draw a snoozefest... But _not all draws are snoozefests_.

- This team is so great!

- Joe Root doesn't understand where he fits in? Top 5 batsmen of all time?! Odd!

- Love the declaration, love the approach, love the first test! A classic test match for the ages. Bravo and chapeau. Speaking of les chapeau, those bucket hats look awful.

- That hour after lunch at Lords... Whut.

- Naming a squad and a team so early in the break while the county game rages on. Whut. What's the point? Why so much open disdain for the County Championships?

- Ali Mitchell: "Will you look back"... Ben Stokes: "No". Ben! We need to talk. It's not a weakness to reflect on decision and learn from them. It's a prerequisite. What's with this Tory-style blunderbuss PR? Where's the honesty, the humility? We can love and applaud a general approach (dare I say brand of cricket ðŸ¤¢) while accepting that moments, decisions, sessions within the brand weren't necassarily the right approach.
