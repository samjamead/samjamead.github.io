Alistair led the top of the descent; he was totally in his element. I was feeling a nervousness that was hard to pin down. I knew, both at the time as well as with hindsight, that I didn't need to feel nervous. The avalanche forcast was low. We'd just climbed the gully and the snow had shown no signs of instability. There wasn't much snow anyway. Still, I was greatful for Ali's leadership.

Perhaps it's healthy to feel nervous. Saws, the sea, Scottish gullies. All places one does well when entering the arena with a healthy dose of fearful respect.
