### Remembering Valerie

On behalf of the grandkids: The five of us each had different relationships with Granny that outside of the big get togethers didn’t tend to overlap much – but I know that we all had similar experiences with Granny, and that one of them usually went something along these lines…

Hello Granny, it’s Sam here

Sam, your grandson

Sam, I’m Alan’s son, your oldest grandson

I’m Alan’s son

Alan is your son

Oh yes, I know all about Maiden Bradley

It might seem cheap to poke fun at the result of an indiscriminate illness, but she bore it with such good humour and her personality was still there shining through.

For me those calls are a happy memory; happy because it seems like such a symbol of Granny, an extension of what she was like in my lifetime.

Whatever trouble she faced, she always coped so well, and as we heard from dad and Anne she had an awful lot to cope with. In the face of physical and mental challenges she displayed a strength and a will to keep going – and it’s that strength that we remember.

A lesson in being so permanently good-humoured, so cheerfully stoic, and such a bloody laugh that you put everyone around you at ease.

I think that captures the essence of what it was like to be a grandchild of dear Valerie.

It was _fun_.

Beyond the five grandkids, her personality endeared her to everyone she came across. When she died, I had a few friends who I thought would want to know, and then I realised the list was actually quite long, and there were school friends and university friends spanning years and years. Those friends wouldn’t have seen her often, but they always remembered her as being the kind and smiling one that we dropped in with on the way to or from university for a tea and a biscuit and a giggle. Even if she didn’t always remember who they were, they remembered her, as we will: good humoured, stoic, and cheerful.

We loved her, and we’ll miss her, but all five of our lives have been brighter thanks to her influence.
