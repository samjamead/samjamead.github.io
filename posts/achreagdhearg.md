> The president is a good man to follow, and as a good follower, I claim the cardinal virtue of obedience, without the technical knowledge of a leader; yet the enjoyment of the skirmisher, 'holding the ropes', is equal to that of any leader. (Walter A. Reid)

> It is axiomatic that, with established reputations, climbers can afford to retreat occasionally. (Walter A. Ried)
