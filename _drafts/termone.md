Zeroth week: Six months to rest and prepare. How hard could it be?! 
First week: this is impossible! (Golf, surfing, Jacob's horror)
Second week: Oh wait, actually I think I can do it 
Fourth week: Things seem to be going quite well... Time to start tweaking my teaching. 
Fifth week: Nice
Sixth week: When is it half term 
Seventh week: Just hanging on 
Ninth week: This is horrible... Oh wait, no, I can do this! Back to performing well. Time to start tweaking my teaching! 
Tenth week: Teaching is improving... Time to start reclaiming some work/life balance! 
Eleventh week: Ah, work/life is better... But teaching has suffered! Don't forget that pedagogy is a thing. 
Twelfth week: Mocks.
Thirteenth week: 
Fourteenth week: 
Fifteenth week:
