#How Saberr Finally Found a Technical Cofounder, or, How Not To Find Yourself a Technical Cofounder

A spontaneous response to [Tech Special – How To Find A Tech Co-Founder](http://www.startupnews.com.au/2016/06/08/tfind-tech-co-founder/) by Marcus Holmes, of Startup News fame.

_**TL:DR** -- As a founder of a tech startup, to acheive success you must learn at the very least a little bit of code. This will allow you to have semi-intelligent conversations with people far cleverer than you, and with a bit of luck turn that into a successful product._

**Before I moved to Perth I was** a cofounder at [Saberr](http://www.saberr.com), a people analytics company based in London. Alistair and I founded Saberr in 2011 while we were still at university, and the chapters in our story of building the company are highly stereotypical:

1. Founders meet at university.
2. Founders found company.
3. Founders drop out of university.*
4. Company moves into garage of founder's parents.
4. Raise money from FFFs.
5. Get rejected from accelerator program.
6. Reapply. Get accepted into accelerator program!
7. Raise money from syndicate of angels.
8. Champagne!

But what the titles of the chapters don't tell is the timeframes involved: _Steps one to seven inclusive took us nearly two years._

The main reason it took so long is because Alistair and I **were both non technical***, and although we were lead by Alistair's awesome vision for the product, we found it very, very hard to make the jump from promising-prototype to reasonably-functional-product given that neither of us could write any useful code.

Here's how we went about aquiring technical talent. Spoiler alert: we did it totally, totally wrong. But don't worry, there's a happy ending!

#### Failed Attempt 1 -- Working with an agency (remotely)

Our first attempt to generate a web presence for the company led us to an online agency in Eastern Europe. They seemed like nice people, quoted cheap, and they worked fast &mdash; furiously coding away to fulfil our brief. Imagine our horror when they sent us back 'the website' and it was _nothing like_ what we'd asked them to produce!

Except that unfortunately for us, it was what we asked them for.

The problem was that I had written the world's crappest brief. I'd totally ignored the fact that I was bluffing my way though all the jargon I didn't understand, and signed off on a scope that bared little resemblance to what we actually wanted. It was as if I had just hummed the brief down the phone; in my head I heard the whole orchestra, but all that the devs heard was out-of-tune buzzing.

**Key learning point:** Non-technical and technical folks need to work together very closely to produce a watertight brief _before_ any code gets written. **Communication is mission critical**; both parties need to understand a) what's expected, and b) what's going to be delivered. [Behaviour Driven Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development) would be an excellent place to start.

#### Failed Attempt 2 -- Hiring a freelancer on the other side of the world. And inviting them to live with you.

For our next trick, obviously still keen for a bit of remote action, Alistair and I found ourselves a developer in Canada, fresh out of university and ready for the startup world. We worked with them for about three months remotely, during which time we became more and more dissapointed and disillusioned with the quality and quantity of their output.

As part of the deal we'd agreed to relocate the developer to the UK from Canada to come and work with us in my parent's garage. Flights were booked. Promises were made. Satisfaction waned even further.

Fortunately for everyone, I came to my senses about two days before the point of no return. I'm not sure what finally tipped me over the edge, but fortunately the result was that we stopped working with the developer; rather than having them move in with us.

**Key learning point:** Recruiting a cofounder requires more stringent criteria than just availibility. You're going to spend more time with this person than your husband / wife / significant other; you better bloody well get on with them. Otherwise it just isn't going to work.

### Step in the right direction 1 -- A little help from a friend combined with f**k it, I'll do it myself!

Sandy to the rescue, plus Sam learning HTML and CSS thanks to the Sites folder in Mac OSX Snow Leopard.

**Key learning point:** You've got to be in it to win it. I quote from Marcus: _'Learning to code is not necessarily about you being able to code the product yourself. It’s more about being able to understand some of the conversations you will be having'_.

### Failed Attempt 3 -- A local option

With Sandy finally pushing us in the right direction we decided to up the ante.

Brad. Didn't work, treated him as too much of an employee. Just wanted him to build us the damn thing. But he was too genius for that! Would have been better at a strategic level, rather than code monkey.

Key Learning Point: Takes more than availability (again), plus trust, and focus.

### Step in the right direction 2 -- Being in the community

Got into accelerator. Still no product. Sandy's made hero's effort to improve our delivery times. Finally mixing with devs who 'get it'.

KLP: Gotta be in it to win it.

### Leap of faith 1 -- The happy ending

Long live Brbora. All hail Brbora! And thanks Sandy.

KLP: Not an employee -- an equal partner.

Epilogue -- by the time I left Saberr, my main role on the product team was front end developer; and now I am a freelance web developer and head of product at Uproute!

*Well, technically we both graduated, but Alistair did put his Engineering docorate on hold. Permenantly.

*Well, technically we were both technical... Just not in anything useful for the web!
