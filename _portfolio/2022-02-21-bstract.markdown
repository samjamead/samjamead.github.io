snippet:        "Jamstack website using the OpenSea API to serve dynamic content"
project-lead:   "Jersey-based artist and talented musician @Bstract is pioneering animated NFTs on the Ethereum blockchain."
project-intro:  "@Bstract needed his website to integrate with the OpenSea API to allow visitors to purchase his artworks. To make sure we didn't lose any performance, we opted for a Jamstack approach to the website build. We used Jekyll as a static site generator, and hosted the website using Kiwi hosting and content-editing platform CloudCannon."
project-stack:  "The result is a static website that loads fast, augmented by dynamic NFT galleries. CloudCannon doubles as the website's content management system, giving @Bstract flexibility to periodically change his featured artwork."
