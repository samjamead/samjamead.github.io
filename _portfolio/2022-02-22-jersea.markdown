project-lead:   "After partnering with British charity Blue Marine Foundation, Jersea needed an online home for their Fish of The Month campaign."
project-intro:  "The Jersea project started with a copywriting brief. Their team wanted the new website to invoke the deep sense of connection that islanders feel for Jersey's coastline and waters."
project-stack:  "In designing and building the website, it was important to make it easy for the Jersea team to add a new fish page each month, in line with their ongoing marketing campaign. Using Squarespace gives Jersea maximum flexibility for updating the website in the future. We built a bespoke Squarespace theme to compliment their excellent existing branding."
