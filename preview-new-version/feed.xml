&lt;h4 id=&quot;inspired-by-the-excellent-beach-not-bitumen-website-i-wrote-a-letter-to-the-relevant-local-government-officials-opposing-the-development-of-a-new-road-in-scarborough-save-scarborough-beach&quot;&gt;Inspired by the excellent &lt;a href=&quot;https://beachnotbitumen.com&quot;&gt;Beach Not Bitumen&lt;/a&gt; website I wrote a letter to the relevant local government officials opposing the development of a new road in Scarborough. Save Scarborough Beach!&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Email Subject:&lt;/strong&gt; Scarborough Redevelopment Area - Public Comment&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;To:&lt;/strong&gt; Liza Harvey MLA, Scarborough Electorate (liza.harvey@mp.wa.gov.au) and Keiran Kinsella, CEO of MRA (reception@mra.wa.gov.au)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;CC:&lt;/strong&gt; Colin Barnett, WA Premier (cottesloe@mp.wa.gov.au); Donna Faragher MLC, Minister for Planning (Minister.Faragher@dpc.wa.gov.au); Karen Caddy, Stirling Coastal Ward Councillor (Karen.Caddy@stirling.wa.gov.au); Mark Irwin, Stirling Coastal Ward Councillor (Mark.Irwin@stirling.wa.gov.au)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am writing to strongly oppose the proposal to extend The Esplanade north and south contained within the MRA’s Scarborough Master Plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a resident of Scarborough (228 West Coast Highway) I find that development projects in Scarborough Beach reduce the quality of life for residents. We currently have reduced access to the beach, an enormous, ugly strip of dirt where grass and trees used to be, and constant construction noise. There is endless slow-moving traffic clogging up the Esplanade as folks do laps and laps looking for parking — because a building site now stands where ample parking used to exist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would be very sad if, in addition to the existing works, a new road was also constructed. Rather than getting relief from the current disruption, we would be subjected to extended frustrations and annoyances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current works on Scarborough Beach have turned the suburb into a dust bowl. When the wind blows from the west or south-west (as it does every single day in summer), dust from the works is blown all across the suburb. My house is constantly dusty. My car is covered in a layer of dust and grit. Plants in my garden have died. Signage on the beach front has been worn away to the point that it needs replacing (e.g. the poster of Mick Fanning above the Rip Curl shop).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please allow us to enjoy our suburb without the main attraction — the beach — being impeded and spoiled by the extra works required to demolish anything standing in the way and develop a new road.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the disturbance from construction, I also strongly oppose the proposal to extend the Esplanade due to the undesirable outcomes of adding a new road in Scarborough beach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would be full of traffic trying to avoid traffic lights on the West Coast Highway. It would detract from the quiet and tranquil nature of Brighton Reserve. It would be dangerous at rush hour. It would impede the many pedestrians and cyclists that currently enjoy a relatively traffic-free Esplanade. It would make it harder to get to the beach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to my opinions, expert opinions do not support additional roads in Scarborough Beach. I am sure you are already aware of studies supporting the improvement of public transport as a more effective and cheaper way to ease traffic and increase public access, for example;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://beachnotbitumen.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/rail_model_report-lr.pdf&quot;&gt;Entrepreneur Rail Model&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; which states that light rail systems can be built by the public sector without cost to the government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;[Stirling City Centre Light Rail Feasibility] Study(https://beachnotbitumen.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/stirling-city-centre-light-rail-feasibility-study-phase-2-lr.pdf)&lt;/em&gt;  which explains that light rail is a suitable option to connect Glendalough station with Scarborough Beach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, there are even studies that show that removing roads, not adding them, will improve the quality of life in Scarborough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@chrisjagers/where-will-all-the-traffic-go-68648bc111ae#.sd7zp2d0&quot;&gt;Where will all the traffic go?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; By Chris Jagers  gives the reasons why removing roads reduces traffic, including removing traffic heading to alternative destinations; and allowing people to more effectively use methods of transport such as walking and cycling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than building a new road I offer the following options as more desirable alternatives:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;— &lt;strong&gt;Creating above and below ground parking options east of the West Coast Highway&lt;/strong&gt; to allow more people direct, easy access to Scarborough Beach without spoiling Scarborough Beach with cars. This would also ensure that West Coast Highway experiences less congestion, as less traffic will be seeking to cross it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;— &lt;strong&gt;Improving public transport access to the beachfront&lt;/strong&gt; to fulfill the vision in the MRA Master Plan of the Transit Hub on Scarborough Beach Road West being a place for high-frequency public transport and world-class walking and cycle ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;— &lt;strong&gt;Removing a portion of the West Coast Highway&lt;/strong&gt; between Brighton Road and Reserve Street. I think it is very telling that the current traffic lights cycle at the intersection of Scarborough Beach Road and West Coast Highway favours north and south moving traffic; not traffic coming to Scarborough Beach. As the above article suggests, removing this portion of the road could significantly reduce traffic in this location. It could return Scarborough Beach to being a destination instead of a rush hour thoroughfare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;— &lt;strong&gt;Consult world leaders in planning to design a plan that reduces traffic to and at the beachfront&lt;/strong&gt;, rather than increases it, making sense of the planned decrease in parking. Maintain and enhance the beachfront with people-friendly areas that encourage more active, safe and healthy engagement with the coast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In closing I quote WA Premier Colin Barnett who recently said “&lt;em&gt;I am tired of seeing our holiday destinations … not having direct access to the beach. Who wants to travel halfway around the world with young children and have their access to the beach separated by a road?&lt;/em&gt;”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hear hear Colin!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for considering the opinions of Scarborough residents. I moved to Perth from the UK and chose to live in Scarborough because it offered the best combination of shops, transport, and entertainment while still maintaining one of the best and most unspoiled beaches in the metro area. Please don’t take that away by building this road.&lt;/p&gt;

There’s a UK edition and a US edition; I get the UK edition, which is (in my opinion) a slightly left-leaning but generally impartial view on the most important news from the previous week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s my favourite news source because it allows me to continue what I think is a good habit I have developed for consuming news. I like to wait until a story has almost blown over before I read about it. That way my opinions are more evenly weighted with the benefit of hindsight, and being able to consider the facts of what actually happened. There’s no hot headed or rushed or rash or one sided arguments otherwise associated with up-to-the-minute news.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Week is weekly and therefore it’s &lt;em&gt;considered&lt;/em&gt; — there’s no pressure for it to report breaking news. So it’s perfect for my preferred cadence of reading the news.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to highlight an example from the 3rd December edition that demonstrates this ability to enjoy the news in a relaxed and nonpartisan fashion. From the &lt;em&gt;Letters&lt;/em&gt; page, which of course features arguments from both sides of the table, right next to each other:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;on-the-topic-of-castros-death&quot;&gt;On the topic of Castro’s death&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;To The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;In praise of Castro&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Without presenting myself as an apologist for Castro, let’s get a little perspective here. Despite history being rewritten by the bitter dispossessed mafia-type businessmen who were thrown out of Cuba, Castro’s revolution disposed the worst dictator in Latin America, who was hell-bent on turning Cuba into the world’s leading supplier of prostitutes (11,500 in Havana alone), drugs and gambling opportunities. Batista made the mafiosi families immensely rich while the people starved.&lt;br /&gt;
Ejected from the country, and their mansions and assets confiscated, they finished up in Florida, from where they have conducted a 58-year-long propaganda war, brokered over 500 failed assassination attempts, attempted a pathetic invasion, and stole the Bacardi and Tropicana brands from Cuba.&lt;br /&gt;
On the plus side, education was amongst the best in the region, exceeding even the US for literacy rates. There was healthcare for everyone, more doctors were trained than anywhere else, and they were sent to help in disasters and epidemics worldwide. Everyone in Cuba was fed, at least up to the standards of wartime rationed Britain. There was little they could not have achieved in economic terms had it not been for the blockade.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Dorian Kelly, Colchester&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;To the Guardian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;A flawed socialist hero&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Many on the left of politics have been paying tribute to Fidel Castro because of the socialist aspects of Cuba under his rule. But given that Castro’s Cuba is also strongly associated with abuses of human rights, and restrictions on liberal values, it doesn’t make sense for the political Left to sympathise with him. Either such abuses of human rights are necessary for establishing that kind of socialist state or they are not.&lt;br /&gt;
If they are necessary, then the example of Cuba has shown that such a socialist state is unacceptable as a social system. If they are not necessary, then by committing such human rights abuses in Cuba, so that they become associated with the idea of a socialist state, Castro has unnecessarily caused significant damage to that cause.&lt;br /&gt;
But either way, Castro hasn’t helped the socialist cause and shouldn’t be lauded as one of it’s champions.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;David Wall, Northampton&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact there are several other excellent examples on the same page, so I will put the whole thing below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gives the phrase ‘old news’ a whole new meaning.&lt;/p&gt;

I am sure Guy would identify himself as a kitesurfer first and foremost, but when he’s not downwinding in 35knots he’s an electrician focused on sustainable energy; in particular solar. This is the story of how Guy helped a tiny village in Papua New Guinea start a sustainable coffee plantation, and how he’s heading back to PNG to help Anengu keep producing solar powered coffee. I will hand things over to Guy to talk in the first person:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;solar-powered-coffee-the-story-of-how-an-australian-kitesurfer-is-bringing-solar-power-to-a-coffee-plantation-in-a-remote-papuan-village&quot;&gt;Solar Powered Coffee: The story of how an Australian kitesurfer is bringing solar power to a coffee plantation in a remote Papuan village.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://uproute-images.s3.amazonaws.com/final-call/solar-powered-coffee/2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Guy with the Village Chief&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a rundown of how I came to be in Anengu village and how that village is doing something unique in PNG. They are trying to bring themselves out of a purely subsistence way of life and into modern world. I say ‘bring themselves’ deliberately, because that is exactly what they are doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With every PNG government department rotten to the core and no money reaching its outlying people for health, education, electricity, roads etc., and banks unwilling to lend them money, they have no access to finance to buy the tools and equipment needed to work their land, harvest and process its produce, and sustain an income. They are stuck in a very primitive existence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Most importantly they have ownership of their land and a life of total freedom incomprehensible to most of us working away everyday for the bossman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They still live in bush material houses and cook only by fire but they do have some small glimpses of the modern world and what it has to offer. Every weekend they send around a collection and put in what small money they have from selling their garden produce, then send someone the four hour walk to the highway junction to buy fuel. The fuel is used to run a generator that powers a TV, so they can beam in the NRL footy games and watch trash Hollywood action DVD’s. It’s entertaining, but the NRL also comes with loads of ads trying to sell them all sorts of crap they ‘need’ like dishwashers, holidays and tin fish (which is literally cat food grade in PNG).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://uproute-images.s3.amazonaws.com/final-call/solar-powered-coffee/3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Guy with the Anengu future&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately this picture of the outside world is what they use as their basis for comparison. Because they don’t have a dishwasher and can’t buy new clothes they really do get the sense of being incredibly poor. This is true to an extent but only in terms of cash. They are not poor like a huge amount of Papuans who have left their land looking for jobs and cash (and dishwashers) in the city. Those Papuan’s end up with nowhere to live, no garden to grow food, and no access to clean water — leaving them with few options other than begging or crime to survive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it’s true that the Village people have very little cash, they do have homes, gardens full of food all year round and endless clean drinking water. Most importantly they have ownership of their land and a life of total freedom incomprehensible to most of us working away everyday for the bossman.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They do need the benefits that modern development brings but they also need to be mindful of its negative aspects too. Some negative things that are already very slightly showing up in the village are alcoholism, gambling, and buying cheap plastic goods and single use batteries that end up littered around the village. I worry that without some direction and a strong central village leadership they might head further down the wrong path.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess my biggest hope is that they will get an understanding of what parts of development are really important to a happy life and a connected community, and what is just the flashy ‘nice to have’ peripheral shit that doesn’t have any long term benefit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I go into the coffee project I’ll just give an explaination of how I came to be in PNG and the village. If you’re already bored and just want to know how the project works then skip this paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://uproute-images.s3.amazonaws.com/final-call/solar-powered-coffee/24.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Guy with the lads...&quot; /&gt;
​&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-backstory&quot;&gt;The Backstory&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2012 I decided that I wanted to go somewhere really off the beaten track and totally unexplored by tourists. I hate to say it but a huge chunk of my previous travel has been bouncing from one lonely planet ‘must see’ to the next getting drunk with other backpackers. While it was heaps of fun there wasn’t really much fulfillment in it and I didn’t balance it as well as I’d like to have with the original intentions of my travel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;On landing in Port Moresby and leaving the airport into what seemed like a war zone I arrived at my security-gated and guarded hotel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess naively, like most young backpackers, I thought I’d being going to exotic countries, meeting the locals, being invited into their homes and experiencing what its like to live in a different culture. The reality being the only locals I could talk to had learnt English for the sole purpose of selling you a Rolax or a tailored suit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted to really test my comfort zone and PNG seemed like the spot. It turned out to be just that and much more. On landing in Port Moresby and leaving the airport into what seemed like a war zone I arrived at my security gated and guarded hotel. I was definitely a bit nervous and after three days of not seeing another tourist I was starting to think maybe I’d bitten off more than I could chew. The only thing I had booked for the whole three months was a stay at the alternative technologies center in the highland town of Garoka and was pretty glad to be on my way out of Moresby four days after arrival.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://uproute-images.s3.amazonaws.com/final-call/solar-powered-coffee/5.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Guy with Wilson&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the flight to Garoka I was lucky enough to be seated next to a PNG local whose English was better than mine. He told me he was on the way back to his village for the first time in three years. His village was called &lt;strong&gt;Anengu&lt;/strong&gt; which is a two-hour drive from Garoka when it’s dry, or a one-hour drive followed by a four-hour uphill walk to the edge of the jungle if it’s been raining and the road is to muddy to drive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He told me he was the only person from his village to ever be university educated, and the village was having a feast to welcome him back. With a fair amount of apprehension over the lack of plumbing and electricity, he invited me to come and experience life in his village. He said I would be the first non-missionary white person to visit the village and that many of the kids under 10 would have never seen a white fella.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was a little nervous and did think that maybe no more white fellas go there cause the last one was eaten. Still, it sounded like an awesome opportunity to see how the locals &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; live. Worth the risk I thought.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://uproute-images.s3.amazonaws.com/final-call/solar-powered-coffee/6.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Guy with Wilson&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turned out to be the best risk I’ve ever taken. The village was amazingly beautiful and the people were unbelievably welcoming. After spending three days eating what they eat (which included a traditional feast of a whole pig cooked in the traditional way) sleeping on bamboo platforms next to them and learning Pidgin English, I felt very comfortable there. They were also very comfortable with me and before I was about to leave many of the village men came up to me and offered to give me some land and build me a bush material hut so I could come back whenever I wanted. I thanked them for the offer but told them I wanted to go and see a bit more of PNG.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After going away that night and thinking about it, I realised this was exactly the kind of traveling experience I’d always wanted. In the end I went back to the village and spent a month there building my own bush material hut.&lt;/p&gt;

​&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-anengu-coffee-project&quot;&gt;The Anengu Coffee Project&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was such an awesome experience that I had to invite my dad and brother over to come and see the place. While they were in the village we organised for some of the young men and boys to guide us on a trek to Wessan, a village much further into the jungle where many of the Anengu residents are originally from.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If a Papuan tells you they walk it in 10 hours, assume it will take you 25 hours. The terrain is insanely rugged and they literally travel barefoot at almost a jogging pace. It’s hard to understand how rugged and wild it is unless you go but these guys really live on the edge of the world. once you go past Anengu it is steep mountainous, almost untouched jungle for days and days of walking. The whole 2 months in the highlands was definitely a highlight of my life and something I’ll always think back on. A huge part of it being the kind of cultural experience I’ve always wanted but never really been able to find anywhere else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had many conversations with Wilson about how he could help bring a better life to the people of his village. We emailed a bit on this subject after I left and as time went by he became more disheartened and frustrated about the situation. In an email to my father and I, he asked us if we could help find him work so that he could earn more money and send it back to his village. My father and I both wrote separate emails along similar lines, the crux of it being that there wasn’t really any point earning more money just to give it away, because no matter how much he earn’t he couldn’t support a village of 300 people. If he kept up the handouts there’d be nothing left for him and his family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t believe in unconditional handouts, I think it fosters laziness and creates dependency and I think he was setting himself up for a long struggle. About six months after that email I received another email from Wilson, this time with a completely different tone. I’m not sure who he had been talking to and how he got the idea but he had decided to put his life savings into a coffee project so he could get the whole village involved and teach them how to help themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://uproute-images.s3.amazonaws.com/final-call/solar-powered-coffee/11.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The Anengu Coffee Project&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wilson’s entire life savings was a total of about $7,000 — which might not sound like much, but it is a huge sum for the average Papuan. He used that money to buy 100,000 coffee seedlings and planter bags, then had the village people build a huge bush material nursery so that the seedlings could be looked after until they were strong enough to plant. At this point he had run out of money so contacted me to see if I could help with some small money to buy fertilizer to ensure the seedlings had the best start possible. After seeing the pictures of nursery and knowing what it could mean to the village I talked to Dad and we both decided to help them purchase the needed fertilizer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-the-project-will-work&quot;&gt;How the project will work&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It had been almost three years since my first visit and I had been wanting to get back there ever since. I decided that now was a great time to go and see the village and find out a bit more detail about their project. When I arrived in the village little had changed from my previous visit, especially the people, who were as welcoming and warm hearted as ever. Of course one notable change was the huge nursery full of little coffee plants. Even though I’d seen pictures of it the scale amazed me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even more Impressive though was the structure of the project itself which was what I was most interested in. As I said before, my fear was that with the project there would be quite a bit of money coming into the village, but without leadership it might do more harm than good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wilson had also considered this and decided to set up a charter and a committee to administer the funds of the project. The main focus of the charter is to bring basic services to the village in a sustainable way. The main things he’s identified are looking into some basic health care in the form of a clinic visited periodically by a nurse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://uproute-images.s3.amazonaws.com/final-call/solar-powered-coffee/12.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The Anengu Coffee Project&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He also included subsidised education for the younger generation and getting some form of electricity in the village that isn’t a petrol generator, among other things. All these things we in developed countries consider the responsibility of Government. In Anengu, they don’t have any meaningful access to these basic things so must work together to bring it to themselves.

  &lt;p&gt;So far there has been limited funding as government funding in PNG tends to disappear without anything to show for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wilson also launched the project and registered it with the provincial government. So far there has been limited funding as government funding in PNG tends to disappear without anything to show for it. They have however provided some drying canvases and some coffee bean processing machines. Hopefully once the land has been prepared and the seedlings planted, the government will see that the villagers are serious and willing to work, and the money is actually being used as intended, there will be a bit more funding made available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically how the project will work is that Wilson will give each village family a share of the seedlings free of charge, which they will have to plant on their land. Wilson studied agriculture at university and is teaching the villagers how to tend their plots and plants to get the maximum yield. He will periodically inspect them and give prizes for the best plots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has already been done since I left. It takes 3 years for the seedlings to mature and fruit. In the meantime he is trying to get all the villagers to start pooling some money to take the project to the next level. This is where the project will either succeed and start producing revenue, or it will fail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the moment the villagers only process the coffee to parchment stage which means removing the husk and drying it on large canvases called parchments. They then individually sell it to factories in town to get about 4 kina/kg (approximately 2 Kina = $1.00). The aim of the project is to eventually get a machine that process the beans to the next stage of refinement, which is the green bean stage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of the villagers selling the parchment beans in town they would now sell them back to the Anengu Coffee
Project to process. The project pays the villagers the same 4 kina/kg for the parchment they harvest, then processes it to green bean, and sells it to the exporters in bulk for 7 kina/kg. The 3 kina profit they make goes directly into the project account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This way the villagers each get money to do with what they please in return for their hard work, and the project also starts getting an independent revenue stream which will cover operational costs and hopefully have plenty left over to fulfill the aims of the project charter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the last visit all the seedlings have been planted and the last email I received this week showed them standing in front of 47 x 60 kg bags from this years harvest of the existing trees. As coffee is seasonal, Wilson has encouraged the villagers to use the money to buy vegetable seeds and chickens. The reason for this is to diversify the crop and to produce some income all year round with the vegetables and to use the chickens to keep down pests and reduce or eliminate the need for any manufactured fertilizers. It is already an incredible achievement for a man who grew up in one of the remotest places on earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I am very very excited and proud when I think of the possibilities and that it’s 100% owned and driven by the villagers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They still have a long way to go but they have some very strong leaders on the project and if they all pull together I think they will create a better life for the entire village and set an example to other Papuans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;editors-note-whats-next-for-the-anengu-coffee-project&quot;&gt;Editor’s Note: What’s next for the Anengu Coffee Project&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Guy has done an incredible job helping Wilson and the village of Anengu grow their project (pun intended) to the scale it’s already reached. As Guy says, there’s a long way to go to make sure the project becomes sustainable financially. To keep helping them, Guy’s next involvement will be to empower the village to reduce their fuel costs by installing solar panels and batteries in the village in September 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He’s currently raising funds to back the installation, and true to form, it’s not just a handout, but a system of loans. For more information on the solar installation and to back the project in it’s next steps, click the big green button!&lt;/p&gt;

I am sure Guy would identify himself as a kitesurfer first and foremost, but when he’s not downwinding in 35knots he’s an electrician focused on sustainable energy; in particular solar. This is the story of how Guy helped a tiny village in Papua New Guinea start a sustainable coffee plantation, and how he’s heading back to PNG to help Anengu keep producing solar powered coffee. I will hand things over to Guy to talk in the first person:</summary></entry></feed>
