###7th July 2015

Had the idea, started validating. Asked 9 people, 3/9 validation, made 2 pre-sales.

###8th July

More validation: 1/4 validation. Extensive customer research. Two competitors - Bop and Qus, and to a certain extent Sonos.

###9th July

Idea for brand name: Honu.

First thoughts on business model and monetisation strategies:

+ Subscription for additional services (potentially unpopular due to other music services also being subscription based)
+ Pay per additional service (low lifetime value)

###10th July

Sketched out first branding concepts.

Plan for blog series. Idea to live-blog the startup at [samjamead.github.io](samjamead) to compare Fusion Founders content to real life.

###11th July

More validation on trains. Target audience are dead easy to spot!

###12th July

What would the MVP be?

+ Queue playlists
+ Export Sonos playlists

Built and launched [samjamead.github.io](samjamead) - the build is ongoing!

###13th July

Started blogging at [samjamead.github.io](samjamead)
