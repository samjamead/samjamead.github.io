        <title>Never Read The Comments</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I’m the 24-year-old CTO of a startup that just raised $2 million. I built all of my company’s tech by myself for the first two years we existed. But, apparently, if I’m on your tech team you should [re]evaluate your life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;[…]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, in a world where Snapchat and Facebook were built in dorm rooms and attracted great engineering teams, I’m going to guess that having a boss in their 20s isn’t cause for serious life-questioning either. I’m going to go out on a limb and say that the real problem is that I’m a woman, and I don’t look like you want a CTO to look.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;[…]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I am proud to be part of a female-led company. I am proud that no one questioned my cofounder’s ability to be our CEO. Women have come very far. But we’re not there yet.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Book Review: Foundation by Isaac Asimov</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I tend to get quite addicted to books very easily. Once I start reading a book that I like, it is extremely difficult for me to put it down. Queue several late night page-smashing missions.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>In Praise of the AK-47</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Q: I had a professor in school who went on and on about how well the AK-47 was designed. He stressed that as designers we should be able to appreciate an object’s design on a purely aesthetic level. Do you agree?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A: Fuck no. Fuck him. Fuck the AK-47. Fuck all guns and the people who design them, but especially fuck Mikhail Kalashnikov, the designer of the AK-47.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://deardesignstudent.com/in-praise-of-the-ak-47-a24cc8a46c13&quot;&gt;Read Mike Monteiro’s post on Medium&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two quotes from Mikhail Kalashnikov which might give some context when considering the rhetorical question at the end of the article:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“I’m proud of my invention, but I’m sad that it is used by terrorists … I would prefer to have invented a machine that people could use and that would help farmers with their work — for example a lawn mower.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Blame the Nazi Germans for making me become a gun designer … I always wanted to construct agriculture machinery.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

        <title>Desert Island Disks</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Desert Island Disks is a BBC Radio 4 programme that’s been running since the 40’s. From Wikipedia:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Guests are invited to imagine themselves cast away on a desert island, and to choose eight pieces of music, originally gramophone records, to take with them; discussion of their choices permits a review of their life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the things I like best is that the presenter (Kirsty Young) doesn’t beat around the bush! She is straight down the line with all of her guests and you often see a side of someone famous that you didn’t imagine. She’s very good at making people seem human.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, no particular order, the eight pieces of music I would take to a desert island, and why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;neighborhood-1-tunnels---arcade-fire&quot;&gt;Neighborhood #1 (Tunnels) - Arcade Fire&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My favourite song of all time. I remember being at an Arcade Fire gig in Cardiff, around 2008 or 2009, and I got more and more nervous with each song they played that they weren’t going to play this track. They ended up playing it in the encore, of course they did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love the sense of desperation in the story. That’s a running theme throughout several of my choices, for some reason I love songs with a sense of desperation or adversity in them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;heroes---david-bowie&quot;&gt;Heroes - David Bowie&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is my Dad’s favourite track and therefore an automatic inclusion on my list! Old Alan was easily the biggest influence on my musical tastes growing up and was very forgiving of a dodgy teenaged foray into rap and hiphop. Dad has a habit of falling in love with songs and playing them over and over until he can’t listen to them anymore, or at least, until they don’t work in the same way any more. However he’s always said that Heroes is immune to the curse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;hallelujah---jeff-buckley&quot;&gt;Hallelujah - Jeff Buckley&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heard this for the first time in a hotel room in Brisbane whilst listening to Triple J count down their Hottest 100 Of All Time (it clocked in at number three). Again, theres a desperation, whatever your interpretation of the track. It’s also quite epic, in an acoustic kind of fashion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;home---edward-sharp-and-the-magnetic-zeros&quot;&gt;Home - Edward Sharp and the Magnetic Zeros&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-little-piece---the-jezebels&quot;&gt;A Little Piece - The Jezebels&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;citizen-erased---muse&quot;&gt;Citizen Erased - Muse&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;exit-music-for-a-film---radiohead&quot;&gt;Exit Music For a Film - Radiohead&lt;/h3&gt;

        <title>We Can&#39;t Handle Salt</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Why don’t whales, that live in salt water and have salt water pass through their mouths, die of thirst?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why doesn’t the fresh water in a marine mammal’s body flow out into the salt water that surrounds it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The answer is that marine mammals and fish have a number of adaptations that allow them to conserve fresh water and excrete salt very effectively. It’s not the cod liver oil you want, it’s the cod’s liver. A liver that can filter the ocean must have other uses. If I had a cod’s liver I bet I could drink a keg of beer and piss turpentine. I could pour soy sauce in my miso soup and drink it with a spoon made of anchovies. &lt;em&gt;Oh, to have the liver of a seal!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>On Geniuses And Lovers</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;“It is very painful, I think, to be told: ‘You enchanted the world for me, you made me feel things I never knew I could, now please be normal at dinner.’ We are always saying this to people in one way or another, of course; maybe we have to.”&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Revolt Against The Desk</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Many writers maintain a private writing hut. The hut has one purpose: it’s the place they go to write. They don’t do anything else there. Once they can’t write any more, they go do something else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s treat our desks the same way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@mijustin/things-ive-quit-doing-at-my-desk-b9cfd73d44e7&quot;&gt;Read Justin Jackson’s post on Medium&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Lean Convert, or, Taking Lean to its Logical Conclusion</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;For a long time I went around telling people how I didn’t really believe in lean. I was pretty proud of that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turns out, I just didn’t understand it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You don’t either, and that’s the problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being lean isn’t the same as bootstrapping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being lean doesn’t mean you build a prototype and throw it out there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being lean doesn’t mean you continually iterate your features until you find product market fit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ashley Aitken helped me understand!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leaving my startup helped me understand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Running a program helped me understand.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Emotional Detachment</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Become emotionally detached from your great idea. Start empathising instead with your customer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your startup is not your product, your startup is your business model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your business model must be repeatable, scalable, revenue generating!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To generate revenue you must have customers…&lt;/p&gt;
