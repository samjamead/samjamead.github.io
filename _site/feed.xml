        <title>A Beginner&#39;s Guide to Bahasa Indonesia</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Selamat Datang panduan pemula untuk Bahasa Indonesia!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/bali1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Mopeds and temples&quot; caption=&quot;A more Indonesian scene you&#39;d struggle to find&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have only been to Indonesia once, but I loved it. I’m supposed to be back there right now, but Mt. Rinjani and her subjects had other ideas… Anyway, my favourite part of the whole trip was speaking the language with the locals. Indonesian (or Bahasa Indonesia, literally &lt;em&gt;the language of Indonesia&lt;/em&gt;) is a pretty easy language to learn. Even for people who speak English as their first language!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s my guide to getting the most out of learning Indonesian. I will tack my “If you’re only going to learn ten phrases then learn these ten” phrases at the end of this post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Indonesians absolutely &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt; foreigners speaking their language.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
It should go without saying, but a tiny effort in the language department goes an extraordinarily long way when you’re visiting &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; new country. This seems to be doubly true in Indonesia. Even by learning just a few little words and phrases, you can guarantee yourself better service, hospitality and respect if you show the locals a little respect by using their own tongue. Even if you only greet people in Bahasa, and say please and thank-you in Bahasa, that elevates you above 90% of the non-effort-making travelers passing through the country. Easy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You’ll be wrong first time. That’s ok!&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
Don’t be put off if you learn a word or phrase, only to be corrected by a local. This seems to be more common in Indonesian than any other language I have dabbled with. More often than not, when I learn new a word from a book and try it out on a local, it’s met with a blank stare of incomprehension. Or, more likely, it’s met with a laugh and swift education of the correct phrase to use in that given situation. Much of what I have learned from a phrasebooks and Google seems to be slightly &lt;em&gt;off&lt;/em&gt; for every day conversation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This seems to be par for the course when learning Bahasa Indonesia. In fact, it’s pretty common to learn a word, try it out, be corrected, and then try the correction on someone new, only to discover that you’re still ‘wrong’ in the ears of the person you’re now talking to! And repeat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Example: ‘Good morning’ in Bahasa is ‘Selamat Pagi’, which officially ends at 11am. After 11am, one should switch to ‘Good day’, or ‘Selamat Siang’. However, half the people you meet will tell you off for using Siang at 11.30, and will insist that one uses Pagi until midday. Even though they aren’t wearing a watch, and they likely don’t know the time anyway!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part of the reason for the misunderstanding is that Bahasa Indonesia is most Indonesian’s second language. They’re more likely to speak the local language or dialect at home and with friends, and only use Bahasa when they’re doing business or shopping or something else involving strangers. For example, in Bali, most people speak Balinese at home, which is a complicated language for a foreigner to understand. That doesn’t mean we shouldn’t try!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On that note, learn a couple of words from the local language.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
And by that I mean learn a little bit of Bahasa Indonesia &lt;em&gt;plus&lt;/em&gt; a little bit of, say, Balinese, or Javanese, or whatever the most prevelent language or dialect is where you’re going. It might seem like extra effort, but even just learning ‘thank-you’ in the local language will earn you bonus brownie points in a restaurant or at your accommodation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Most pronunciation is phonetic, with a few notable exceptions.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
A few rules to go by:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;‘c’ is always pronounced ‘ch’&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Roll your ‘r’s&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Vowels seem to change pronunciation a lot.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you get the pronunciation wrong don’t worry, they’ll correct you! It’s the effort that counts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Indonesians speak really really fast.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
If you don’t understand someone, ask them to slow down. All to often if you don’t catch what’s said first time, it will be repeated in English, which is no good for learning! So make sure you jump in quick with ‘tolong bicarra lagi pelan pelan’ (please say again slowly).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, if what &lt;em&gt;you’ve&lt;/em&gt; said isn’t understood first time, try saying it again as fast as you can. Don’t worry if your words mash together and you lose some accuracy in pronunciation — you’re more likely to be understood if you speak fast rather than correctly!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lastly, call everyone sir or madam at the end of each sentence.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
Use &lt;em&gt;Pak&lt;/em&gt; (sir) and &lt;em&gt;Ibu&lt;/em&gt; (ma’am) to address everyone you meet. You’ll seem courteous, polite, and culturally aware in the company of your hosts. Litter your conversation with lots of sirs and ma’ams for maximum effect!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;if-youre-only-going-to-learn-ten-phrases-learn-these-ten&quot;&gt;If you’re only going to learn ten phrases, learn these ten:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;All of these translations are spelled phonetically - don’t use this for written comms! This guide is designed to be spoken only…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Please may we speak in English [pak / ibu]?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
Minta apakah kita bisa bicarra Bahasa Ingris [pak / ibu]?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sorry [sir / madam] I don’t speak Indonesian!&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
Ma’af [pak / ibu], saya tidak bisa bicarra Bahasa Indonesia!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;May we have some lunch?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
Minta kami makan siang? &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;small&gt;It’s good to say this when you enter a restaurant, as it isn’t always obvious as to why you’re there (most places offer other services too, such as laundry or accomdation). Switch out ‘siang’ for ‘pagi’ or ‘melam’ to ask for breakfast or dinner respectively. &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Two large Bintang’s, please!&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
Minta dua Bintang besa &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Same again, please!&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
Minta satu lagi! &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;small&gt;Literally ‘please may I have one again’, so if you want to order two of the same, use ‘minta dua lagi’, and so on.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I already have one thanks.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
Suda punya terimah kasih. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;small&gt;An easy and polite way to decline an unwanted offer of a bracelet, snorkelling trip, massage, etc.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Please may I have 2 million Rupia using a visa card?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
Minta dua juta Rupia munggunakan visa? &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;small&gt;This one is very useful at a money exchanger (you can sometimes get a better rate than at an ATM). &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;See you later!&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
Sampai jumpa lagi &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;small&gt;Literally means ‘see you again’. &lt;strong&gt;Never say goodbye to anyone&lt;/strong&gt; — they’ll find it rude! &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;May I bargain [sir / ma’am]?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
Boleh saya tawar [pak / ibu]? &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;small&gt;Great one to use at the start of a haggling session. Be aware that the person you’re dealing with might say ‘tidak!’ (no). Some things (like fuel) are fixed price and can’t be haggled over.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thank you&lt;/strong&gt; (in Balinese) &lt;br /&gt;
Sook-sa-moor &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;small&gt;To which they’ll say ‘mo-ali’.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where are you staying?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
Dimana anda tinggal? &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;small&gt;Expect to be asked this all the time! Usually, this is just small talk, so it’s ok to say ‘Saya tinggal di sudut’ which means ‘I’m staying around the corner’. &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thus concludes the beginners guide to Bahasa Indonesia!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully that’s enough to get you started. Of course it’s also important to learn the numbers, and the basics of please, thank you, and the various hellos. But these are the phrases I have used most often and for some reason, phrasebooks for languages all around the world have a general reluctance to teach novice linguists anything of any actual use!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good luck…&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Isaac Asimov</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I could list Asimov quotes for days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;To succeed, planning alone is insufficient. One must improvise as well.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;— Salvor Hardin&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the book &lt;em&gt;Foundation&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bonus quote! Also from &lt;em&gt;Foundation&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Never let your sense of morals prevent you from doing what is right.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;— Salvor Hardin&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which I particularly love, because it begs the question: “Are morals universal or relative?”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To which the best answer I have heard so far is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Morality is simply one man’s way of justifying a personal view of what is right and wrong. It is the rightness or wrongness that is universal and thus transcends morality.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;— Simon MacFarlane&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interesting side-story — “Are morals universal or relative?” was one of the original 29 &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.saberr.com&quot;&gt;Saberr&lt;/a&gt; test questions! I always used to answer ‘universal’, but now I might have to answer differently…&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Never Read The Comments</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The gender gap in the tech scene is a hot topic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I’m the 24-year-old CTO of a startup that just raised $2 million. I built all of my company’s tech by myself for the first two years we existed. But, apparently, if I’m on your tech team you should [re]evaluate your life. … And, in a world where Snapchat and Facebook were built in dorm rooms and attracted great engineering teams, I’m going to guess that having a boss in their 20s isn’t cause for serious life-questioning either. I’m going to go out on a limb and say that the real problem is that I’m a woman, and I don’t look like you want a CTO to look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I am proud to be part of a female-led company. I am proud that no one questioned my cofounder’s ability to be our CEO. Women have come very far. But we’re not there yet.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>In Praise of the AK-47</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Q: I had a professor in school who went on and on about how well the AK-47 was designed. He stressed that as designers we should be able to appreciate an object’s design on a purely aesthetic level. Do you agree?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A: Fuck no. Fuck him. Fuck the AK-47. Fuck all guns and the people who design them, but especially fuck Mikhail Kalashnikov, the designer of the AK-47.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://deardesignstudent.com/in-praise-of-the-ak-47-a24cc8a46c13&quot;&gt;Read Mike Monteiro’s post on Medium&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A quote from Mikhail Kalashnikov which might give some context when considering the rhetorical question at the end of the article:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“I’m proud of my invention, but I’m sad that it is used by terrorists … I would prefer to have invented a machine that people could use and that would help farmers with their work — for example a lawn mower.”&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Desert Island Disks</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Desert Island Disks is a BBC Radio 4 programme that’s been running since the 40’s. From Wikipedia:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Guests are invited to imagine themselves cast away on a desert island, and to choose eight pieces of music, originally gramophone records, to take with them; discussion of their choices permits a review of their life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the things I like best is that the presenter (Kirsty Young) doesn’t beat around the bush! She is straight down the line with all of her guests and you often see a side of someone famous that you didn’t imagine. She’s very good at making people seem human.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, no particular order, the eight pieces of music I would take to a desert island, and why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;neighborhood-1-tunnels---arcade-fire&quot;&gt;Neighborhood #1 (Tunnels) - Arcade Fire&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My favourite song of all time. I remember being at an Arcade Fire gig with my Dad in Cardiff, around 2009 or 2010. I’d gone across from Uni in Southampton on the train. I got more and more nervous with each song they played that they weren’t going to play this track. They ended up playing it as the second encore. Of course they did. I love the sense of desperation in the story. That’s a running theme throughout several of my choices, for some reason I love songs with a sense of desperation or adversity in them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;heroes---david-bowie&quot;&gt;Heroes - David Bowie&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is my Dad’s favourite track and therefore an automatic inclusion on my list! Old Alan was easily the biggest influence on my musical tastes growing up and was very forgiving of a dodgy teenaged foray into rap and hiphop. Dad has a habit of falling in love with songs and playing them over and over until he can’t listen to them anymore, or at least, until they don’t work in the same way any more. However he’s always said that Heroes is immune to the curse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;hallelujah---jeff-buckley&quot;&gt;Hallelujah - Jeff Buckley&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heard this for the first time in a hotel room in Brisbane whilst listening to Triple J count down their Hottest 100 Of All Time (it clocked in at number three). Again, there’s a desperation, whatever your interpretation of the track. It’s also quite epic, in an acoustic kind of fashion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;home---edward-sharp-and-the-magnetic-zeros&quot;&gt;Home - Edward Sharp and the Magnetic Zeros&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-little-piece---the-jezebels&quot;&gt;A Little Piece - The Jezebels&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;citizen-erased---muse&quot;&gt;Citizen Erased - Muse&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;exit-music-for-a-film---radiohead&quot;&gt;Exit Music For a Film - Radiohead&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve hit publish on this… Even though it isn’t finished. It’s actually really hard! First of all to narrow down all of the music in the world to just 8 tracks, and secondly to justify why they’ve made that list. Maybe I will come back and finish this one day. Maybe not.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>We Can&#39;t Handle Salt</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Why don’t whales, that live in salt water and have salt water pass through their mouths, die of thirst?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why doesn’t the fresh water in a marine mammal’s body flow out into the salt water that surrounds it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The answer is that marine mammals and fish have a number of adaptations that allow them to conserve fresh water and excrete salt very effectively. It’s not the cod liver oil you want, it’s the cod’s liver. A liver that can filter the ocean must have other uses. If I had a cod’s liver I bet I could drink a keg of beer and piss turpentine. I could pour soy sauce in my miso soup and drink it with a spoon made of anchovies. &lt;em&gt;Oh, to have the liver of a seal!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Revolt Against The Desk</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Many writers maintain a private writing hut. The hut has one purpose: it’s the place they go to write. They don’t do anything else there. Once they can’t write any more, they go do something else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s treat our desks the same way.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;“It is very painful, I think, to be told: ‘You enchanted the world for me, you made me feel things I never knew I could, now please be normal at dinner.’ We are always saying this to people in one way or another, of course; maybe we have to.”&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Lean Convert, or, Taking Lean to its Logical Conclusion</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;For a long time I went around telling people how I didn’t really believe in ‘lean’. And I was pretty proud of that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turns out, I just didn’t understand it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You don’t either, and that’s a big issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being lean isn’t the same as bootstrapping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being lean doesn’t mean you build a crappy prototype and throw it out there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being lean doesn’t mean you continually iterate your features until you find product market fit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you do it right, you may achieve some (or all) of those things as a &lt;em&gt;byproduct&lt;/em&gt; of ‘running lean’. But, and this is crucial, &lt;strong&gt;they aren’t inherently part of the lean movement&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be honest, I didn’t really understand lean (and many other concepts that are key to launching a startup successfully) until some time after I left &lt;a href=&quot;http://saberr.com&quot;&gt;Saberr&lt;/a&gt;. It took a certain amount of time away from the game to let it all sink in. A big part of understanding is &lt;strong&gt;accepting that it is of paramount importance to be 100% emotionally detached from both the strategic and tactical decisions that are made in your startup&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That doesn’t mean you can’t be passionate: you should certainly be passionate, but be passionate &lt;em&gt;about the problem you are solving&lt;/em&gt;. And that is a very different proposition to being passionate about the company itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, it doesn’t mean you mustn’t love your product. You should love and believe in your product, but only because it’s a gorgeous and elegant solution to the problem. And to achieve that, emotionally detached, fact-based decision making is key.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Emotional Detachment</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Become emotionally detached from your great idea. Start empathising instead with your customer. See the wood; it’s made up of the trees! This, in some ways, is a Buddhist philosophy in itself (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/harris/bl141.html&quot;&gt;further reading here&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your startup is not your product, your startup is your business model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your business model must be repeatable, scalable, revenue generating!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To generate revenue you must have customers…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And guess what. To get customers, you have to make decisions that you disagree with on an emotional level.&lt;/p&gt;
