Well, that's it – my PGCE is complete. As well as qualified teacher status, I was very pleased to receive the [Ted Wragg Award](https://www.exeter.ac.uk/teachertraining/apply/feesandfinance/tedwraggawards/) from the University of Exeter, an unexpected but lovely surprise.

Nobody could have predicted that the course would end in the way that it did: delivered remotely, dominated by video conferences, distinctly lacking in children to teach. I imagine that much will be written of the 2020 NQT cohort's disrupted training, but actually, I really enjoyed the different format.  

> Counterintuitively, I am sure I will be a better teacher in September for having _missed_ a term of teaching in the classroom.

Although it was disappointing not to be able to visit a new school for a second placement, the summer term ended up being my favourite part of the course. The content (compiled and delivered on very short notice by the ITT staff at the University of Exeter, kudos and my thanks to them!) was interesting and useful, and, after six months of hearing how important the process of reflection is for teachers, we finally had the time to reflect ourselves.  

This period of reflection was far more time than I ever would have [had, had](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_while_John_had_had_had_had_had_had_had_had_had_had_had_a_better_effect_on_the_teacher) things stuck to the original plan. It has helped me relate theory to practice in ways I couldn't see before. I doubt I would have made the same links on placement, where reflection is easily forgotten amongst an ever-increasing teaching workload and the usual assignments and paperwork.   

In fact, somewhat counterintuitively, I am sure I will be a better teacher in September for having _missed_ a term of teaching in the classroom. In addition to being a better teacher, I am also much more in tune with the field of education as a whole.

While the aim of initial teacher training is to prepare new teachers to be effective in the classroom, the parts of the course that really grabbed me all seemed to fall _outside_ of the classroom.   

These are the bigger issues; issues relating to the field of education as a whole, and in particular they are issues adversely affecting secondary education in the UK. So, as a newly qualified teacher with an interest in research education, I come into the profession with four areas of focus, and four big questions:

**1 – Teacher recruitment and retention**  
Despite [various initiatives](https://getintoteaching.education.gov.uk/) from the government, certain subjects are still undersupplied, and around one third of new teachers will [leave the profession](https://www.tes.com/news/why-do-so-many-teachers-quit-within-five-years) within five years. Why?

**2 – The attainment gap**  
By the time disadvantaged children reach Year 7, [they are 9.5 months behind](https://educationendowmentfoundation.org.uk/public/files/Annual_Reports/EEF_Attainment_Gap_Report_2018.pdf) in terms of attainment. This gap widens to 19.3 months by the time they finish secondary school (and COVID-19 has [undoubtably made this worse](https://52papers.org/posts/year1week25)). Schools are putting many interventions in place to help disadvantaged children, so why does the gap keep widening?  

**3 – Grouping of students**  
Setting is almost ubiquitous in the UK, yet there is [plenty of evidence](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/ioe/departments-and-centres/centres/best-practice-grouping-students) to suggest that a) it [widens the attainment gap](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0305764X.2015.1093095), and b) students themselves [don't like it](https://52papers.org/posts/year1week28). Why does setting remain so popular, when it's leading to worse outcomes for students?

**4 – The research-practice gap**  
The research-practice gap is [well established](https://52papers.org/about). Teachers do not have access to academic journals, or the time in a normal working week to search, filter, and digest research recommendations. On top of this, educational research is not always relevant to teachers<sup>1</sup>, extending search and filtering times. Why is it so hard for teachers to engage with relevant research in education?

<hr class="hr-narrow-center" />

It's my hope that I can address these issues as my career progresses. As a start, I recently launched [52papers.org](https://52papers.org), a contribution to closing the research-practice gap.  

At 52 Papers, once each week I post a five-minute summary of a research journal in education – my aim is to help teachers engage with research by cutting down the time it takes to search, filter, read and digest recent journal articles.  

One paper per week. Summarised. [In your inbox](https://52papers.org/subscribe).

It's only small, but it's a good first step. I look forward to your feedback!
