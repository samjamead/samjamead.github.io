project-lead:   "Jersey-based artist and talented musician @Bstract is pioneering animated NFTs on the Ethereum blockchain."
project-intro:  "@Bstract needed his website to integrate with the OpenSea API to allow visitors to purchase his artworks. To make sure we didn't lose any performance, we opted for a Jamstack approach to the website build. We used Jekyll as a static site generator, and hosted the website using Kiwi web service CloudCannon."
project-stack:  "The result is a blazing fast website with dynamic NFT galleries. Cloudcannon doubles as the website's content management system, giving @Bstract flexibility to periodically change his featured artwork."
