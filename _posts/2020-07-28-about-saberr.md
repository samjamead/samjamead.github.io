Much like the Queen, Saberr has two birthdays, and from the perspective of the July one, she just turned eight (eight!). Here's a short origin story, with a link to what's coming next at the end.  

<hr class="hr-narrow-center" />

Towards the end of my undergrad (BSc Oceanography), I founded a company with two friends at university. It's a quintessential startup story. We even worked out of my parents' garage.

Originally, our idea was to run flotilla sailing holidays for graduates, similar to [The Yacht Week](https://theyachtweek.com/how-it-works).

Our USP was to guarantee that you'd get along with the other people on your yacht. A lofty ambition, but before we'd even found a skipper, we realised that this was probably the most valuable part of our offering! Three became two, and we pivoted to focus full time on team dynamics.

[Saberr](https://saberr.com) was born in May 2012 with a mission to radically improve the way teams work together. We built an algorithm that helps organisations build high performance teams based on team dynamic and interpersonal relationships.

In building the company we followed the most typical journey a digital enterprise startup can imagine: We started with a cool idea for some tech â€” an algorithm that predicted the performance of teams based on the team dynamics. We left university and moved into the aforementioned garage. We worked all night. We raised a small funding round. We got our first clients. We were accepted into Seedcamp, Europe's best accelerator. We built a team of talented, generous, and hard-working people. We hired someone with more experience to be our CEO. We raised a bigger round from a syndicate of great angels. It was an amazing few years!

I left Saberr after nearly three years to follow a dream of living in Australia. By the time I left, the team was 9 people and growing, and today Saberr is still run by my cofounder Alistair. He's been through two more funding rounds, expanded the team, and many, many, many more product releases.  

Ali has written a great piece about Saberr's origin story and our motivations when starting the company: [Saberr: The backstory and the future](https://www.saberr.com/blog-posts/the-backstory-and-the-future).
