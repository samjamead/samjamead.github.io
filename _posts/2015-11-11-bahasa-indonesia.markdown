Selamat Datang panduan pemula untuk Bahasa Indonesia!

I have only been to Indonesia once, but I loved it. I'm supposed to be back there right now, but Mt. Rinjani and her subjects had other ideas... Anyway, my favourite part of the whole trip was speaking the language with the locals. Indonesian (or Bahasa Indonesia, literally <em>the language of Indonesia</em>) is a pretty easy language to learn. Even for people who speak English at their first language!

However, learning the right way is not quite so straight forward. More often than not if I learnt a word from a book and tried it out on a local, it was met with a blank stare of incomprehension. Or, more likely, it was met with a swift correction of the correct phrase to use in that given situation; much of what I learned from a phrasebook seemed to be slightly <em>off</em> for every day conversation. Actually sometimes I was even rude to someone, just by using words I had literally learned from the dictionary seconds earlier. Culture is a magical thing!

So, what follows isn't necessarily the same as you'd find in a guidebook or phrasebook, but it seemed to work for me.

Part of the reason for the misunderstanding is that Bahasa Indonesia is most Indonesian's second language. They're more likely to speak the local language or dialect at home and with friends, and only use Bahasa when they're doing business or shopping or something else involving strangers. For example, in Bali, most people speak Balinese at home, which is an extremely complicated language for a foreigner to understand. Doesn't mean we shouldn't try! I have included a couple of Balinese words below.


###A beginner's guide to Bahasa Indonesia, or, how I learned the magic words to use in Bali to get a smile from anyone.

<em>All of these translations are spelled phonetically - don't use this for written comms! This guide is designed to be spoken only...</em>

A few rules to go by:

* 'c' is always pronounced 'ch'
* Roll your 'r's
* If you get the pronunciation wrong don't worry, they'll correct you! It's the effort that counts.

&nbsp;

**Hello** &mdash; Depends on the time of day. See below!

**Good morning** &mdash; Selamat pagi (use this up until 11am)
<br /><small>Open to interpretation! Some folks seemed to think 'pagi' finishes at 11am, some folks said midday. Whatever.</small>

**Good day** &mdash; Selamat siang (use this from 11am to 3pm)

**Good afternoon** &mdash; Selamat sore {sawrrey} (from 3pm to dark)

**Good evening** and **Good night** &mdash; Selamat melam (after sunset)

<em>Each of those can be shortened to a friendly greeting / farewell. Eg. a bright and cheerful 'pagi!' will suffice!</em>

**Sorry [sir / madam] I don't speak Indonesian!** &mdash; Ma'af [pak / ibu], saya tidak bisa bicharra Bahasa Indonesia!

**Can you speak English?** &mdash; Apakah anda bisa bicharra Bahasa Ingris?
