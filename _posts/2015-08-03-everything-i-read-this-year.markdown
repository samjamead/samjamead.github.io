Here's a great big long list of everything I've read this year, in order.

<br />

###_A Song Of Ice and Fire_ - George R. R. Martin

I had to read this after I finished watching Season 4 of HBO's Game of Thrones. I was not disappointed. The books are infinitely better than the TV series, and I **loved** the TV series. I only hope GRRM doesn't die before he finishes the planned end to the books. Good grief.

###_On The Road_ - Jack Kerouac

The thing that struck me most about this book was both the pace and flexibility of life. Work shifts seem to last days, nights out seem to last weeks. Amongst it all the pure romance of adventure is the only fuel keeping everyone moving.

###_Birdsong_ - Sebastian Faulks

I tend to get quite addicted to books very easily. Once I start reading a book that I like, it is extremely difficult for me to put it down. Queue several late night page-smashing missions.
