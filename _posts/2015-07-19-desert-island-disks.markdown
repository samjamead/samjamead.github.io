Desert Island Disks is a BBC Radio 4 programme that's been running since the 40's. From Wikipedia:

> Guests are invited to imagine themselves cast away on a desert island, and to choose eight pieces of music, originally gramophone records, to take with them; discussion of their choices permits a review of their life.

One of the things I like best is that the presenter (Kirsty Young) doesn't beat around the bush! She is straight down the line with all of her guests and you often see a side of someone famous that you didn't imagine. She's very good at making people seem human.  

So, no particular order, the eight pieces of music I would take to a desert island, and why.

###Neighborhood #1 (Tunnels) - Arcade Fire
My favourite song of all time. I remember being at an Arcade Fire gig with my Dad in Cardiff, around 2009 or 2010. I'd gone across from Uni in Southampton on the train. I got more and more nervous with each song they played that they weren't going to play this track. They ended up playing it as the second encore. Of course they did. I love the sense of desperation in the story. That's a running theme throughout several of my choices, for some reason I love songs with a sense of desperation or adversity in them.

###Heroes - David Bowie
This is my Dad's favourite track and therefore an automatic inclusion on my list! Old Alan was easily the biggest influence on my musical tastes growing up and was very forgiving of a dodgy teenaged foray into rap and hiphop. Dad has a habit of falling in love with songs and playing them over and over until he can't listen to them anymore, or at least, until they don't work in the same way any more. However he's always said that Heroes is immune to the curse.

###Hallelujah - Jeff Buckley
Heard this for the first time in a hotel room in Brisbane whilst listening to Triple J count down their Hottest 100 Of All Time (it clocked in at number three). Again, there's a desperation, whatever your interpretation of the track. It's also quite epic, in an acoustic kind of fashion.

###Home - Edward Sharp and the Magnetic Zeros

###A Little Piece - The Jezebels

###Citizen Erased - Muse

###Exit Music For a Film - Radiohead

I've hit publish on this... Even though it isn't finished. It's actually really hard! First of all to narrow down all of the music in the world to just 8 tracks, and secondly to justify why they've made that list. Maybe I will come back and finish this one day. Maybe not.
