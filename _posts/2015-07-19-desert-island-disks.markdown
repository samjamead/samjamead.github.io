In no particular order, the top eight pieces of music I would want on a desert island.

+ Neighborhood #1 (Tunnels) - Arcade Fire
+ Heroes - David Bowie
+ Hallelujah - Jeff Buckley
+ Home - Edward Sharp and the Magnetic Zeros

Four down, four to go... It's not as easy a task as it seems!

More to add to the list:

+ A Little Piece - The Jezebels
+ Citizen Erased - Muse
+ Exit Music For a Film - Radiohead
