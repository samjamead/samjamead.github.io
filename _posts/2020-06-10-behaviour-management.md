Behaviour management is often cited as a something. With that in mind I did this course. Five key things stuck in my mind:

1. It's important to **recognise** student progress and positive behaviour. [Frequently recognising 'micro-behaviours'](https://www.notion.so/samjamead/Week-3-Intelligent-Use-of-Recognition-to-Motivate-Students-d8acc0b5286640d3b33969c392352f37#5806e36e51384363aa8314d5f4d70435) is a powerful way to reinforce positive behaviour. [Avoid using extrinsic reward](https://www.notion.so/samjamead/Managing-Behaviour-for-Learning-Future-Learn-a3e7facebc1b4344a1a13090a47a7adc), which can be inconsistent, unfair, and counterproductive (and maybe even a version of unethical behaviourism, too...).
2. Two
3. Three
4. Four
5. Five
