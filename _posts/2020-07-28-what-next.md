Well, that's it – my PGCE is complete. QTS in the bag, and an unexpected but most welcome Ted Wragg award tucked away in the back pocket, too.

Appreciated the disrupted summer term, it helped me relate theory to practice. It also gave time to reflect, far more time, in fact, than I ever would have [had had](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_while_John_had_had_had_had_had_had_had_had_had_had_had_a_better_effect_on_the_teacher) things gone to plan.

While the focus of the year is undoubtably learning how to become an effective teacher in the classroom, the parts of the course that really grabbed me were (bigger).

Four questions:

1. Recruitment and retention of teachers
2. The attainment gap
3. The way we group students.
Despite plenty of evidence to suggest it's not the best thing we can be doing, setting students is still almost ubiquitous in the UK.
