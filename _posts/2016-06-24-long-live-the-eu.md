## To the 17,410,742 people who voted for the UK to leave the EU:

<br />

*TL;RD - I am very disappointed by how selfish just over half of the people in the UK have turned out to be.*   

I remember watching V for Vendetta a few years ago and thinking that I was so lucky to live in a world where it just wouldn't be possible for such a dystopian future to take hold of the UK in real life.

After today I am not so sure. Nineteen Eighty-Four was not supposed to be a blueprint.

Somebody just asked me what happened. The only thing I can come up with at the moment is that there are more selfish people in the UK than I previously thought: Unfathomably selfish senior politicians that drove a campaign of fear and sensationalism into a crowd of people (who were apparently equally selfish) that couldn't jump on board fast enough.

It's a shame that we didn't listen to Norway - who told us that if we left and still expected to play nice with Europe, we would have to abide by the EU's rules. Rules that we will no longer have a say in creating.

It's a shame that we didn't listen to the US, China, Japan, and Germany - the four world economies larger than the UK - who each told us that we are the 5th largest global economy *because* we're a part of the EU, not despite it.

It's a shame we didn't listen to the economists - who told us what would happen to our currency if we left. It was quite a shock to see the value of my savings decrease by 6.5% between breakfast and lunch.

It's a shame that it will become harder for Brits to retire to the south of France, Spain, and Portugal - now the NHS will have to cope without the relief of some of our ageing population moving overseas.  

And lastly, it's a shame we didn't listen to common sense - although as Ren√© Descartes wrote; common sense is the most evenly distributed trait amongst men, because no man wishes he had more of it.

For the UK to so brazenly declare that we no longer wish to support the rest of the EU is sad and upsetting; we shall surely lose out culturally, economically, and morally as a result. In some ways, we already have!

**To the 16,141,241 people who voted remain: Thank you. We fought the good fight.**
