  <p>A framework for reflecting on lesson plans</p>

  <section class="intro">
     <p>This essay tries to incorporate everything I know about delivering a lesson where students <strong>learn</strong>. For thoughts on behaviour management in the classroom, I also wrote an essay on <a href="/behaviour/">making reactive practice proactive</a>.</p>

    <h2>Giving instructions</h2>
    <p>"Please ask questions now if there is anything I haven’t explained properly" is so much better than "does everyone understand". Can you dual code this?</p>
    <p>Tell students what you want them to do, not what you don't want them to do. Imagine a student not following your instructions. Rehearse getting that student (or group of students, or <strong>class</strong>) back on task!</p>
    <p><em>Show</em> students what you want them to do, e.g. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0_mi8ngNnM&feature=emb_rel_end">pressing buttons on a calculator</a> for 3 part equations where you rearrange to have x 'over' y.</p>

    <h2>Questioning</h2>
    <p>(See notes on Wiliam – be sure to link questioning and learning via making students think, memory is the residue of thought, etc.)</p>
    <p>Fermi questions</p>
    <ul>
      <li>How long would it take to slide down a pole from the moon to earth?</li>
      <li>How many moles in a mole?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Memory is the residue of thought. [Add notes (and footnotes) from effectiveLearningTask.docx]</p>
    <p>E.g. Chris' poster lesson examples of different tiers of questioning, AO1, 2, 3. low - medium - high order questioning</p>

    <h2>Student Lead</h2>
    <p>"The bulk of a lesson should be student lead,"  they cried. "Don't do all the work, make <em>them</em> do the work".</p>
    <p>Makes sense, but how? This implies 'activities', but activities take time to prepare, so isn't this just me still doing the work, just in my evenings and on my weekends?</p>
    <p>Plus, there's a view that activities are just timefillers, and we don't want that. What activities are actually worthwhile? What activities help students <strong>learn</strong>?

    <h2>Learning</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Spaced practice</li>
      <li>Interleaving</li>
      <li>Retrieval practice</li>
      <li><strong>Timeliness of feedback</strong></li>
      <li>Elaboration</li>
      <li>What was the sixth one?</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Linking the curriculum to the world</h2>
    <p>Imagine, in most classrooms, a teacher would project a picture of a leaf, rather than go outside and actually <em>look</em> at a leaf!</p>
