<p class="lead">Kobe Bryant is the greatest basketball player of all time.</p>

<p>I've been watching basketball for a long, long time, and up until very recently, I was not a big fan of Kobe.</p>

<p>The first game of basketball I ever watched live was the Knicks @ the Magic, which makes me a) a Magic fan, and by extension b) a Tracy McGrady fan. If you're a T-Mac fan there's no way you're a Kobe fan, especially not while Tracy is leading the league in scoring and crashing out of the playoffs in the first round every year.</p>

<p>Even after T-Mac went all Knicks-Pistons-Hawks-Qingdao on us (oh how I wish the Spurs could have been the happy ending!) I still didn't come round to the Black Mamba in a hurry. He was too selfish, too cold, too <em>good</em> for me to be a fan. There's nothing 'underdog' about him, so I wasn't going to be rooting for him.</p>

<p>Yet here I am... Writing a piece on how I think Kobe's the GOAT.

<p>Better than MJ.</p>

<p>I guess that says it all.</p>
