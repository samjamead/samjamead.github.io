I could list Asimov quotes for days.

>To succeed, planning alone is insufficient. One must improvise as well.
>
>&mdash; Salvor Hardin

From the book _Foundation_.

Bonus quote! Also from _Foundation_:

>Never let your sense of morals prevent you from doing what is right.
>
>&mdash; Salvor Hardin

Which I particularly love, because it begs the question: "Are morals universal or relative?".

To which the best answer I have heard so far is:

>Morality is simply one man's way of justifying a personal view of what is right and wrong. It is the rightness or wrongness that is universal and thus transcends morality.
>
>&mdash; Simon MacFarlane

Interesting side-story &mdash; "Are morals universal or relative?" was one of the original 29 [Saberr](http://www.saberr.com) test questions! I always used to answer 'universal', but now I might have to answer differently...
