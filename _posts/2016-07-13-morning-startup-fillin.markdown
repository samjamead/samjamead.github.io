![Talking to the Morning Startup](/img/ms1.jpg)

The Morning Startup ([meetup.com/Morning-Startup-Perth](http://www.meetup.com/Morning-Startup-Perth/)) had a last minute dropout, so Dave asked me to come along and rehash my talk to the Founder Institute on developing MVP experiments. This version is a little bit more detailed; I had 40 minutes instead of 20 at the Founder Institute.

Thanks again to Niche Interview for the recording. [nicheinterview.com/morning-startup-perth-sam-mead-minimum-viable-product-mvp-13-july-2016](http://www.nicheinterview.com/morning-startup-perth-sam-mead-minimum-viable-product-mvp-13-july-2016/)
