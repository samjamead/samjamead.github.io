project-lead:  "Designed as a functional resource for busy teachers, the 52 Papers website served as a CPD repository."
project-intro:  "An important part of the 52 Papers web build was the tagging filtering system. Summary authors needed to apply multiple tags to each post, and readers needed to be able to quickly filter by tag. We also included a tag-based suggested reading prompt to make further reading more relevant."
