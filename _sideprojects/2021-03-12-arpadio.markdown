project-lead:   '"The process of rating players can be compared to the measurement of the position of a cork bobbing up and down on the surface of agitated water with a yard stick tied to a rope and which is swaying in the wind."
— Arpad Elo.'
project-intro:  "A JavaScript web app, built to experiment with the Google Firebase real-time database. Arpadio uses a slight variation of the Elo rating algorithm to rate players against each other based on the expected outcome of head-to-head matches."
project-stack:  "The project uses jQuery to create a basic MVC application. Using Google Firebase, the app uses two JSON blobs as database, and data is updated for all web users in real-time when new players or results are added to the blobs."
