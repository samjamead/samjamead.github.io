project-lead:   '"The process of rating players can be compared to the measurement of the position of a cork bobbing up and down on the surface of agitated water with a yard stick tied to a rope and which is swaying in the wind."

project-intro:  "A little jQuery web app, built to experiment with the Google Firebase real-time database. I used a different instance of the app to rank friends playing table-tennis over the course of an Australian summer. "
project-stack:  "The project uses jQuery to create a basic MVC application. Using Google Firebase, the app uses two JSON blobs as database, and view updates for all web users in real-time when new players or results are added to the blobs."
