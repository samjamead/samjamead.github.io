      <p class="big-lead">Hello – I'm Sam, a freelance web developer and copywriter in Jersey. I also tutor in secondary maths and physics.</p>
      <p>I write copy and build websites for all kinds of clients. I work with JavaScript and CSS, and use a wide variety of front-end platforms, including Jamstack, Wordpress and Squarespace.</p>

      <p class="lead">I write copy and build websites for all kinds of clients &mdash;</p>
      <p>&mdash; this year I've worked with a marine conversation charity, artists, an electrical engineer, nutritionists, and a blockchain company.</p>
      <p>In the last 10 years I've done some other things, too: cofounded a SaaS tech startup; lead B2B marketing at a C-Series healthcare startup; and taught physics at high-school level.</p>
      <p>I'm committed to helping those who are less fortunate than I am (as well as the planet). To that end I'm a member of Giving What We Can, One Percent for the Planet, and since September 2020 I've planted 875 trees with Ecologi.</p>
