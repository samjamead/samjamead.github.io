    <h3>About</h3>
    
    <p>In 2011 I cofounded my first company with some friends from university. It didn't go very well, but my <a href="http://saberr.com" target="_blank">second</a> attempt has done much better.</p>
		<p>Since moving to WA in February 2014 I've been helping other startups, entrepreneurs and small businesses avoid some of the mistakes that Iâ€™ve made along the way. Call it mentorship, advice, coaching, or whatever &mdash; I love helping others in the startup world.</p>
		<p>If you're interested in having a chat, I'd love to hear from you, so drop me an <a href="mailto:samjamead@gmail.com?&subject=G'day%20Sam&body=I have a project you might be interested in working on..." target="_blank">email</a> and let's start the conversation.</p>
		<p>Outside of tech startups, I'm passionate about making the world a little bit more environmentally conscious, as well as surfing, skiing, and camping.</p>
