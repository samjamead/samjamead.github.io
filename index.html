     <h1>Hello! I'm Sam, a marketer and web developer with a particular interest in copywriting, campaign distribution, and web page performance.</h1>
     <p>Iâ€™m passionate about making the world a little bit more environmentally conscious. About finding an alternative to capitalism. Surfing, skiing, and camping. And Oxford commas, golf, and woodwork. Reading. And languages. I have too many hobbies.</p>
     <p>For the moment I'm enjoying a sabbatical, so there's not much here about my professional life. You can find that over on <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/samjamead" target="_blank">my LinkedIn profile</a>.
