#### Inspired by the excellent [Beach Not Bitumen](https://beachnotbitumen.com) website I wrote a letter to the relevant local government officials opposing the development of a new road in Scarborough. Save Scarborough Beach!

**Email Subject:** Scarborough Redevelopment Area - Public Comment<br />
**To:** Liza Harvey MLA, Scarborough Electorate (liza.harvey@mp.wa.gov.au) and Keiran Kinsella, CEO of MRA (reception@mra.wa.gov.au)<br />
**CC:** Colin Barnett, WA Premier (cottesloe@mp.wa.gov.au); Donna Faragher MLC, Minister for Planning (Minister.Faragher@dpc.wa.gov.au); Karen Caddy, Stirling Coastal Ward Councillor (Karen.Caddy@stirling.wa.gov.au); Mark Irwin, Stirling Coastal Ward Councillor (Mark.Irwin@stirling.wa.gov.au)<br />


I am writing to strongly oppose the proposal to extend The Esplanade north and south contained within the MRA’s Scarborough Master Plan.

As a resident of Scarborough (228 West Coast Highway) I find that development projects in Scarborough Beach reduce the quality of life for residents. We currently have reduced access to the beach, an enormous, ugly strip of dirt where grass and trees used to be, and constant construction noise. There is endless slow-moving traffic clogging up the Esplanade as folks do laps and laps looking for parking — because a building site now stands where ample parking used to exist.

It would be very sad if, in addition to the existing works, a new road was also constructed. Rather than getting relief from the current disruption, we would be subjected to extended frustrations and annoyances.

The current works on Scarborough Beach have turned the suburb into a dust bowl. When the wind blows from the west or south-west (as it does every single day in summer), dust from the works is blown all across the suburb. My house is constantly dusty. My car is covered in a layer of dust and grit. Plants in my garden have died. Signage on the beach front has been worn away to the point that it needs replacing (e.g. the poster of Mick Fanning above the Rip Curl shop).

Please allow us to enjoy our suburb without the main attraction — the beach — being impeded and spoiled by the extra works required to demolish anything standing in the way and develop a new road.

In addition to the disturbance from construction, I also strongly oppose the proposal to extend the Esplanade due to the undesirable outcomes of adding a new road in Scarborough beach.

It would be full of traffic trying to avoid traffic lights on the West Coast Highway. It would detract from the quiet and tranquil nature of Brighton Reserve. It would be dangerous at rush hour. It would impede the many pedestrians and cyclists that currently enjoy a relatively traffic-free Esplanade. It would make it harder to get to the beach.

In addition to my opinions, expert opinions do not support additional roads in Scarborough Beach. I am sure you are already aware of studies supporting the improvement of public transport as a more effective and cheaper way to ease traffic and increase public access, for example;

_[Entrepreneur Rail Model](https://beachnotbitumen.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/rail_model_report-lr.pdf)_ which states that light rail systems can be built by the public sector without cost to the government.

_[Stirling City Centre Light Rail Feasibility] Study(https://beachnotbitumen.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/stirling-city-centre-light-rail-feasibility-study-phase-2-lr.pdf)_  which explains that light rail is a suitable option to connect Glendalough station with Scarborough Beach.

In fact, there are even studies that show that removing roads, not adding them, will improve the quality of life in Scarborough.

_[Where will all the traffic go?](https://medium.com/@chrisjagers/where-will-all-the-traffic-go-68648bc111ae#.sd7zp2d0)_ By Chris Jagers gives the reasons why removing roads reduces traffic, including removing traffic heading to alternative destinations; and allowing people to more effectively use methods of transport such as walking and cycling.

Rather than building a new road I offer the following options as more desirable alternatives:

— **Creating above and below ground parking options east of the West Coast Highway** to allow more people direct, easy access to Scarborough Beach without spoiling Scarborough Beach with cars. This would also ensure that West Coast Highway experiences less congestion, as less traffic will be seeking to cross it.

— **Improving public transport access to the beachfront** to fulfill the vision in the MRA Master Plan of the Transit Hub on Scarborough Beach Road West being a place for high-frequency public transport and world-class walking and cycle ways.

— **Removing a portion of the West Coast Highway** between Brighton Road and Reserve Street. I think it is very telling that the current traffic lights cycle at the intersection of Scarborough Beach Road and West Coast Highway favours north and south moving traffic; not traffic coming to Scarborough Beach. As the above article suggests, removing this portion of the road could significantly reduce traffic in this location. It could return Scarborough Beach to being a destination instead of a rush hour thoroughfare.

— **Consult world leaders in planning to design a plan that reduces traffic to and at the beachfront**, rather than increases it, making sense of the planned decrease in parking. Maintain and enhance the beachfront with people-friendly areas that encourage more active, safe and healthy engagement with the coast.

In closing I quote WA Premier Colin Barnett who recently said “_I am tired of seeing our holiday destinations … not having direct access to the beach. Who wants to travel halfway around the world with young children and have their access to the beach separated by a road?_”.

Hear hear Colin!

Thank you for considering the opinions of Scarborough residents. I moved to Perth from the UK and chose to live in Scarborough because it offered the best combination of shops, transport, and entertainment while still maintaining one of the best and most unspoiled beaches in the metro area. Please don’t take that away by building this road.
