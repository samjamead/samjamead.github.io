Behaviour management is often cited as a something. With that in mind I did this course. Five key things stuck in my mind:

1. It's important to **recognise** student progress and positive behaviour. [Frequently recognising 'micro-behaviours'](https://www.notion.so/samjamead/Week-3-Intelligent-Use-of-Recognition-to-Motivate-Students-d8acc0b5286640d3b33969c392352f37#5806e36e51384363aa8314d5f4d70435) is a powerful way to reinforce positive behaviour. [Avoid using extrinsic reward](https://www.notion.so/samjamead/Managing-Behaviour-for-Learning-Future-Learn-a3e7facebc1b4344a1a13090a47a7adc), which can be inconsistent, unfair, and counterproductive (and maybe even a version of unethical behaviourism, too...).
2. Never assume that students know how to behave to your standards. You have to [show them, teach them, and remind them](https://www.notion.so/samjamead/Week-2-Using-rules-and-routines-to-achieve-consistency-e32ba6b4945b4d47b509d9c6ad5b568d#b1396f32be1348d5843e5f970d9cad1f).
3. Create [micro-scripts](https://www.notion.so/samjamead/Week-4-Reducing-friction-when-students-behave-badly-e74b3dd6eaa8430c99327b710afd05fd#1cb7090947ca4e29856f01031545ac35) to deal with frequent or feared scenarios. Practice them with 'good', or easier classes before using them in more challenging situations. These scripts take emotion out of heated situations and allow students a chance to calm down.
4. Give students '[take up time](https://www.notion.so/samjamead/Week-4-Reducing-friction-when-students-behave-badly-e74b3dd6eaa8430c99327b710afd05fd#0993e4a1e0ea46388a227480df79e05d)' – enough time to digest and follow your instructions. Students often react emotionally rather than rationally. This is because the [amygdala](https://www.google.com/search?sxsrf=ALeKk03BtJGzLWilzLh3c3C_hw9n3rcJsA%3A1596804404459&ei=NE0tX7XZG9G8gQai35LYCw&q=Amygdala+hijack&oq=Amygdala+hijack&gs_lcp=CgZwc3ktYWIQAzIFCAAQsQMyAggAMgIIADICCAAyAggAMgIIADICCAAyAggAMgIIADICCAA6BwgAEEcQsANQrWZYrWZg8WxoAnAAeACAAUWIAXuSAQEymAEAoAECoAEBqgEHZ3dzLXdpesABAQ&sclient=psy-ab&ved=0ahUKEwi1w7b6j4nrAhVRXsAKHaKvBLsQ4dUDCAw&uact=5), the part of the brain that deals with processing emotion, is not fully formed until 25 years of age. A burst of emotion can block students' rational brains.
5. [Punishment is not the answer](https://www.notion.so/samjamead/Week-5-Reparation-and-restorative-practice-7c65396ac97c42a3a3920d37dd9d9813); there are other routes available.

In the words of Paul Dix:
