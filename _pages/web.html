      At its heart, web design should be about words. Words don't come after the design is done. Words are the beginning, the core, the focus.<br />Start with words.<br />
      <span>&mdash;Justin Jackson</span>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Web design, marketing, and social media all boil down to one thing: <a href="https://justinjackson.ca/words.html">Words</a>.</p>
    <p>Words are the most important part of any project.</p>
    <p>You can borrow words, reuse them, take inspiration from the greats.
